No Fall Mechanism

This mechanism uses 2 wheels to propel 
itself forward and in case of falling
on the edge of some hard material
it uses it's third wheel to move sideways, thus not falling.

I chose this mechanism because
I wanted to challange myself with a
project that can move forward and even do better.

The main components are the Chasis, the Wheels and Gears and the cone upfront.

Any wheel can be turned but in reality
the wheel at the back is moving first, since it is powered by the servomotor.

My project contains .f3d, .stl, and .png types of file.

The programme for modelling the projects was Fusion 360, and for the printing part, Prusa Slicer.

The main resourse was forked from Greg Zumwalt (https://www.instructables.com/id/No-Fall-Toy-Mechanism/) the author of this model.
