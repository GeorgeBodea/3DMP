# Homework 2
- I have uploaded the final remix of a gas mask and my own straps so one can hold the mask to his/her face.
- After many redesignings I have chose a medium complexity strap that work in this manner: puting the clip on the mask slot,
put the auxliary part (the box with a hole in it) in the clip spot, put the screw (the cylinder) on its place the tie the strap within
itself taking the last part and putting it through the blank space. Tie the last 4 straps in any way you want. (2 by 2 or all togheter in
one node).
- The mask works with P100 filters.
